          <p className={styles.p}>Most of the time an interview will take place in three parts:</p>
          <ul className={styles.p}>
          <li>First the hiring manager may begin by talking to you about the role and the company</li>
          <li>Followed by a discussion about yourself, skills and experience and answering their questions</li>
          <li>Finally most interviewers will give you the opportunity to ask questions</li>
          </ul>
          <p className={styles.p}>You need to be prepared and be able to discuss each topic. To clarify your thoughts and communicate clearly, we advise you to use the star method.</p>
          <p className={styles.p}>During the job interview, the employer will expect you to be able to talk about your experience and link it to what their company needs. You also have to show them why you are interested in working for this company and in this particular position.</p>

            styles.h2}>3. Analyse your professional performance.</h2>
          <p className={styles.p}>Sit down with your CV and analyse your strengths, your weaknesses and what you have achieved. Review your professional experience to give examples that will show the recruiter that you are the perfect fit for the position. What are your ambitions? How have you overcome challenges in your professional career? Ask yourself what could cause concern for the manager regarding your application.</p>

            styles.h2}>4. Study, practice and practice again.</h2>
          <p className={styles.p}>This is an important point. We advise you to spend some time preparing for the interview and answers to the questions the employer may ask you. This is like going into an exam, you will feel more confident if you studied beforehand. Don’t get caught out on basic questions you have not prepared for.</p>
          <p className={styles.p}>Pro tips:</p>

          <h2 className={
            styles.h2}>5. Prepare questions for the interviewer.</h2>
          <p className={styles.p}>To stand out from the crowd, we recommend you ask questions at the end of the interview. It will show your interest and that you are comfortable asking questions and listening to feedback. Review the job advert and note all the questions you have about the role. Try to limit them to six.</p>
          <p className={styles.p}>Examples:</p>
          <ul className={styles.p}>
            <li>Can you tell me more about my day to day tasks?</li>
            <li>Can you tell me more about the team?</li>
            <li>What is the biggest challenge you and your team are facing at the moment and how could I help you?</li>
            <li>What does success mean for you? What will be my KPIs?</li>
            <li>What traits do your top performers have in common?</li>
            <li>Can you tell me more about the person I will report to?</li>
            <li>May I ask you what is your/their management style?</li>
            <li>Do you have any hesitation or concerns about my qualifications? This last question will enable them to overcome any remaining concerns. Give relevant examples that will reassure them. If for example you have not used a software they have, tell them about a time when you have taught yourself how to use a specific software and how you managed this... watching online videos, going to conferences, asking experts on forums, etc…</li>
          </ul>
        </div >
